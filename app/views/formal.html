          Time limits
          </h2>

          <p>You usually have 3 months minus 1 day to notify us of a tribunal claim. When this runs from will depend on the type of claim you are making. This time limit continues to run even if you raise the problem formally with your employer.<p>
          <p> If you are unsure about the time limit for your claim, you might want to get legal advice.<p>
